# Introduction

The DIRAC Interware Project provides software and a large set of ready to use components to build distributed computing systems of arbitrary complexity. It ensures access to various types of computing and storage resources with a single intuitive user interface. Both Workload and Data Management subsystems are available which provides a complete solution for creating computing systems for multiple research user communities. DIRAC is used by multiple large scientific collaborations. The services based on the DIRAC interware are also provided by several large national and international grid infrastructures.
